Devops
======

This is a rewrite of a proprietary devops tool I wrote for a company. The goal is to remove a lot of the company-specific business logic while keeping the guts in-tact.

More details to follow.


Why?
----
Because PHP is not as useless as some make it out to be. Symfony is an amazing framework, and using it as the foundation of a cli can allow PHP devs to do more with their code without having to resort to mixing languages to get the job done. If you write a PHP cli tool to help a PHP team, you've now enabled that team to help with maintaining the cli too.

Should I use this?
------------------
For the foreseeable future, no. This is a working code sample for me. Maybe in the future I'll throw it out for more adoption.
